                        Reciprocal relationships, those that involve a mutual give-and-take and exchange of support, have many well-established benefits. However, the day-to-day experiences of reciprocal relationships for individuals with mental health conditions have been less well-documented. This document is the first in a series of resources that seeks to uplift the voices of individuals with lived experience of mental illness and reflects their experiences of meaningful relationships.   It contains the responses of individuals with mental health conditions to a series of survey prompts about the ways they both receive and provide support to someone important to them.   Following the responses of individuals with lived experience are brief strategies for service providers and peers to encourage individuals to reflect on their own experiences of reciprocal relationships.

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Forensic Peer Specialists are part of an emerging workforce comprised of individuals with a history of mental illnesses and incarceration who have achieved a reasonable degree of stability in their own lives and are now employed by local government and non-profit agencies to provide individualized support to others with both psychiatric disabilities and criminal justice involvements. However, since the field is new, qualifications and responsibilities are defined variously from site to site. This policy brief, based on an informal national environmental scan with forensic peer specialist programs across the county in 2011, seeks to define what we know at present about this new workforce and to establish a research agenda for the future.</p>
