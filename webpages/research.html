                    To achieve our mission, The Temple University Collaborative researchers focus on the meaning and importance of community inclusion in the lives of those with serious mental health issues, and as a medical necessity.  We are interested in: the degree to which community inclusion does or does not characterize the day-to-day realities for people in recovery; the barriers that make genuine community inclusion, in one domain or another, difficult to achieve; and the effective public policy, program design, and practice interventions that constitute best practices in promoting community inclusion â€“ as well as the strategies for improving the research technologies needed to address these issues adequately.
                    <br/>
                    The Temple University Collaborative research agenda also relies heavily on a collaborative process. We seek to involve consumers and family members, researchers and policy makers, program managers and direct service practitioners, community members and academic researchers in all aspects of the research process: defining topics, framing methodologies appropriate to the topics, gathering reliable data, analyzing results, and translating these results into usable information, products, and policy recommendations for the field.
